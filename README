Contents of submission:
defrag.h	defrag.c	Makefile	README

Usage:
1. To create executable version of defrag, run "make" command.
2. Use "make clean" with CAUTION, as it will clear any file apart from the above mentioned submissions from the current directory.
3. To deframent a disk image, run the following command:
	./defrag <image_name>

Input:
1. defrag will take exactly one parameter; it will exit with error if any less or any more is provided.
2. The input image name can't be "disk_defrag", and if that is given, the program will exit. The input image could be renamed and then provided as an input.
3. The program will also return with error if input image doesn't exist, or output file can't be created.

Output:
1. The output of the program will be named as "disk_defrag" and placed in the current directory, and any previous file with same name will be overwritten.
